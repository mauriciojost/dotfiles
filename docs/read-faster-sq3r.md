# SQ3R reading method

- Survey (skim): don't read, only see chapters, headings, sub-headings, figures, summaries)
- Question: What is this chapter about, What question does it answer? How does this help me? 
- Read: Now read actively but only to answer Q
- Retrieve: Try to explain with simple words what has been read (answers to Q)
- Review: Make a summary of the whole chapter using your own words potentially coming back to the material if needed
