# Transistors

From [here](https://www.instructables.com/id/BC547-Switch-Circuit/)

The transistor we are going to use has three terminals collector, emitter and base. 
Out of these the base is for controlling the input across collector and emitter. The transistor has three operating regions:

1)Saturation region (on)
2)Cut-off region (off)
3)Active region (amplifier)
