# README

This project creates directories of applications with configuration files that are 
overwritten according to a profile chosen. 

For instance: `hadoop` with profile `client1`, and `hadoop` with profile `client2`.

## Execute

Muahahaha be a man, just execute the damned build-profile-directory.sh script!!!

It will create an output folder overriding what is found in the other listed folders (edit the script if needed).
