# Keyboard

To be able to type French accents, use the Compose Key.
Basically it allows you to go to a compose mode temporarily, where a symbol key stroke merges with a letter key stroke.

I chose to have Left Win key as my compose key.

Examples: 

```
- to get é : [Left Win] ' e
- to get è : [Left Win] ` e
- to get ê : [Left Win] ^ e
```
