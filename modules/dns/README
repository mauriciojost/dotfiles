Then you need to change your hostname to:
<hostname>.<domainname>
like 
pepa.marten

Then restart all networking services.

You can verify your changes by doing:
   defi@pepa:~/.dotfiles/module-dns$ hostname --short
   pepa
   defi@pepa:~/.dotfiles/module-dns$ hostname --domain
   marten
   defi@pepa:~/.dotfiles/module-dns$ hostname --long
   pepa.marten

If being in a computer whose domain is X you ping
ping A 
then Linux will try to resolve A and A.<your-domain>, 
i.e. A.X . 
It means that pinging 
   ping router
you will be pinging 
router.marten which indeed is defined in the forward zone 
configuration file, reason why the resolution will work (
and you will successfully be able to ping router.marten).
