# README

To take advantage of the autocompletion please download Vundle doing the following. The already existent .vimrc file will use Vundle to install plugins.

```
git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

After this is done please run in `vim` the following command:

```
:PluginInstall
```

And that is all!
