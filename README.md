# README 

This is my .dotfiles project. Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine. Welcome!


## Getting started

Clone the project in ~/.dotfiles and then: 

```
$ git clone x ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ ./install.sh

git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your `$HOME` and `$HOME/.config` directories.
